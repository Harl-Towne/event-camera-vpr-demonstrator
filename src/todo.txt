toask:

bugs:
Tonic filters are very slow
## integration appears different betwen live and recorded  - seems to have fixed itself
## window won't allow images to be shrunk - sorta fixed

todo:
think about using tonic for noise filters and stuff - sperate frame generator class probably
display for % of real time
3d voxel plot - https://github.com/cedric-scheerlinck/jupnote_event_demo/blob/master/main.ipynb
add "fast event draw" option
test on daytime bag
look into new library

look into firenet for HDR demo
events over time plot (with ROI)


priority:
bug fixes
organise github
voxel plot
firenet
