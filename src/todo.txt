toask:
should the integral slider work on live data


bugs:
Tonic filters are very slow
extra long recordings (>10s) slow live playback causing dropped eventpackets


todo:
##intigration window sliderbar
##playback location sliderbar - more information in general (current time, total time)

think about using tonic for noise filters and stuff - sperate frame generator class probably

look into firenet for HDR demo
events over time plot (with ROI)
3d voxel plot
