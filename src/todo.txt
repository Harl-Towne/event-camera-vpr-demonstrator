toask:

bugs:
Tonic filters are very slow
integration appears different betwen live and recorded 
window won't allow images to be shrunk

todo:
##intigration window sliderbar
##playback location sliderbar - more information in general (current time, total time)

think about using tonic for noise filters and stuff - sperate frame generator class probably
## make integration period work on live data
## show regualar image - events drawn on image
## record regular image for playback
display for % of real time
3d voxel plot - https://github.com/cedric-scheerlinck/jupnote_event_demo/blob/master/main.ipynb
add "fast event draw" option

look into firenet for HDR demo
events over time plot (with ROI)


priority:
bug fixes
voxel plot
firenet
